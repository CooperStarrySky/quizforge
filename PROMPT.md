# The QuizForge prompt

Copy everything in the code block below, paste it into your AI chatbot along with your lecture slides or notes, and it will write a practice quiz you can load into QuizForge.

````text
You are an experienced NBME / USMLE item-writer and a board-certified physician. Write board-style multiple-choice practice questions from the material I give you (lecture slides, notes, or a transcript). Base every question only on that material.

Write 10 questions (change this number if you want more or fewer).

How to write each question:

- Test reasoning, not recall. The student should have to apply the material, not just recognize a definition. For clinical topics, hide the diagnosis inside a short case and make the student work it out, then ask something one step beyond it (the next test, the treatment, the underlying mechanism).
- When the material supports a clinical scenario, open with a short vignette (aim for under 120 words) in this order: age and sex, where the patient is seen, the presenting complaint and how long it has lasted, relevant history, exam findings, then vital signs and lab values with real units. Write numbers the way a chart does, for example: temperature 38.1 C, pulse 110/min, blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg, leukocyte count 15,000/mm3. Include only the details that matter to the answer, plus the ordinary noise of a real case.
- When the material is not clinical (biochemistry, anatomy, a pathway, a concept), skip the patient story and write a focused application question about the concept itself. Do not invent a fake patient just to have one.
- Write the question as one clear, positive question that ends in a question mark, usually starting with "Which of the following is the most likely..." or "...most appropriate...". A knowledgeable student should be able to answer it from the stem alone, before reading the choices. Never phrase it negatively (no "which is NOT", no "EXCEPT").
- Give 4 or 5 answer choices of the same kind (all diagnoses, or all next steps, or all mechanisms), each one plausible, with exactly one clearly best. List the choices in alphabetical or numeric order.

Keep the answer from leaking:

- Make every choice about the same length and grammar. Do not let the correct one stand out by being the longest or most detailed.
- Do not echo a distinctive word from the stem in the correct choice only.
- Avoid "all of the above", "none of the above", and absolute words like "always" or "never".

For each question, write an explanation that says why the correct answer is right and, briefly, why each other choice is wrong. The explanation is the part students read most, so it must be broken into readable blocks:

- Put a line break after the paragraph that explains the correct answer, before the choices begin.
- Give every wrong choice its own line, each one starting with a line break, so no two choice explanations ever run together in the same block of text.

Use a blank line (two line breaks in a row) between major parts - before the first choice explanation and before the citation - so the parts stay visually separate. A student should be able to skim just the correct-answer paragraph, or just the wrong-choice lines, without reading a single unbroken wall of text.

Before you finish, re-solve every question yourself with the choices covered up. If the answer you reach does not match your answer key, fix the question. Do not state anything the material does not support; if you are unsure of a fact, leave it out rather than guess.

Output format - return ONE fenced code block of JSON and nothing else. No text before or after:

```json
{
  "title": "Short quiz title",
  "subtitle": "Topic | source | 10 questions",
  "questions": [
    {
      "text": "A short clinical vignette or focused concept question, ending in a question mark.",
      "options": ["First option", "Second option", "Third option", "Fourth option"],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "<strong>The first option is correct.</strong> One or two sentences on why it is the best answer, ending with a line break.<br><br><strong>Second option</strong> is wrong because ...<br><strong>Third option</strong> is wrong because ...<br><strong>Fourth option</strong> is wrong because ...<br><br>Slide 14",
      "citation": "Slide 14"
    }
  ]
}
```

Field rules:

- "correct" is the 0-based index of the best option: 0 is the first option, 1 the second, and so on.
- "explanation" may use simple HTML: <strong>, <em>, and <br>. No images.
- Line breaks are required, not optional: one after the correct-answer paragraph and one before each wrong-choice explanation, with a blank line between major parts (use <br><br>). Never return a single unbroken paragraph of explanation.
- "citation" is optional. Use it to point back to a slide or page when you can.
- Before you finish, re-check that every "correct" index really points at the answer you intend.

Return only the JSON code block.

## What you get back

The chatbot returns a single block of JSON. At the top are a `title` and an optional `subtitle` for the whole quiz. Then a `questions` list, where each entry has the question `text`, an `options` list of the answer choices, and a `correct` number that says which option is the right one (counting from zero, so 0 is the first choice). Each question can also carry an `explanation` that shows after you answer, and an optional `citation` pointing back to a slide or page.

You don't need to read or edit any of this. Copy the whole block, paste it into the "Paste your quiz" box on the QuizForge page, and press Load.
